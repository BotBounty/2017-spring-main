# Assignment 1: Information Theory and TensorFlow

## Due: January 22, 11:59p Pacific

This assignment consists of two unrelated parts:

* [Infomation Theory Review](Information Theory.ipynb)
* [TensorFlow Introduction](tensorflow/fun_with_tensorflow.ipynb)

While we're releasing them at the same time, we strongly recommend that you do that [Assignment 0](../a0/) first to verify that you're all set up with IPython and TensorFlow.

**Hint:** James will be going through Assignment 1 in the extra office hour in Week 2 (January 18 at 6:30pm Pacific). Please come with your questions!

We anticipate you will spend most of your time on the TensorFlow introduction.
TensorFlow is a somewhat different programming model than you may be used to. 
Similar to MapReduce, it breaks constructing the computational graph and executing it into two separate steps. 
Some students describe this introduction as the hardest 10 lines of code they've had to write - but we promise that it gets a *lot* easier from there!

## Submission instructions
